/**
 * Shared contract for secret providers.
 *
 * Dockhand is provider-agnostic about where secrets come from. A secret
 * provider knows how to authenticate against one backend (1Password, Infisical,
 * HashiCorp Vault, ...), and supports one or both resolution modes:
 *
 *   1. Reference interpolation — a variable's value is an inline reference in
 *      that backend's own syntax (e.g. 1Password's `op://vault/item/field`),
 *      which the provider replaces with the real secret. Detection of what
 *      counts as a reference is provider-specific (see `isReference`).
 *   2. Bulk pull — fetch every secret under a provider-defined selector (a
 *      1Password Environment id, an Infisical project/environment/path, a Vault
 *      kv path, ...) as a flat key/value map.
 *
 * Concrete providers live in sibling files and are registered in ./index.
 * Decrypted config (tokens, hosts) is passed in by the caller and never
 * persisted here — providers hold it only for the duration of a call.
 */

 *   - `token` — a ready-to-use API access token / service token, sent as-is.
 *   - `clientId` + `clientSecret` — a Machine Identity authenticating via
 *     Universal Auth (`POST /api/v1/auth/universal-auth/login`). The provider
 *     exchanges these for a short-lived access token and caches it until it
 *     is close to expiry.
 *
 * When both are present, Universal Auth takes precedence (a static token is
 * the legacy/simple path; Machine Identity is the least-privilege path teams
 * moving off shared service tokens want). `token` stays required-by-config-shape
 * as optional so existing configs keep working unchanged.
